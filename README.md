# Windows DPI Aware Manifest Helper

This simply writes a manifest file disabling DPI Awareness using arg 2 (The full path to the exe) and adds .manifest.

If the app in question has an embedded manifest you have to go a different route explained [here.](http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-fix-apps-that-look-small-on-high-dpi-and-high-resolution-displays/)
